  <h2>Management Summary</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <p>Behind every successful construction project lies a sequence of decisions made long before the first concrete is poured. These decisions are shaped by the quality of information available at the right moment. This Open Design Learning response explores how digital information systems can turn complex project data into meaningful support for decision making. The Snowdon Towers project is used as a case study to demonstrate this potential.</p>
    <p>The assignment applies seven core concepts to real digital artifacts. A BIM Execution Plan establishes an organizational structure and sets clear rules for collaboration. Integrated BIM models connect architectural, structural, and MEP data into a single information environment. This integration makes conflicts visible. Clash detection and 4D simulations expose coordination and planning issues that would otherwise emerge during construction. This makes decision making proactive instead of reactive.</p>
    <p>Maintenance and asset management systems reuse BIM data to support operational control and long term planning. Sustainability analysis reveals where environmental impact is created. Safety oriented information systems translate abstract risks into visible site conditions.</p>
    <p>The final concept looks forward. Digital twins and virtual sensor data illustrate how buildings can continue to generate value after completion. Performance is no longer assumed but measured. Maintenance is no longer scheduled but predicted. Together, the artifacts show that information systems are not passive repositories. They actively shape how projects are designed, built, and operated. When information is structured and shared effectively, it becomes a strategic asset that improves control, transparency, and long term project value.</p>

      <p><u>Main processes</u></p>
        <p><i>Design and planning</i></p>
        <p>Architectural, structural, and MEP design takes place to form the initial concept design. An initial 3D BIM model is created, with preliminary 4D and 5D integration. Clash detection is used to ensure a feasible design.</p>
        <p><i>Procurement</i></p>
        <p>A competent contractor is selected through a competitive tendering process, and suitable materials, components, and digital solutions are procured. The supply chain is coordinated through a centralised platform.</p>
        <p><i>Construction management</i></p>
        <p>Execution of the project is carried out with BIM workflows. Time and cost are controlled through 4D and 5D BIM integration, respectively. Digital solutions are deployed on-site, for example augmented reality.</p>
        <p><i>Health, safety, and compliance</i></p>
        <p>Real-time health, safety, and compliance is ensured through a variety of means, including open risk registers, digital method statements, automatic sensing, and liaison with all involved personnel.</p>

    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Artifact</strong></h3>
      <p>This concept starts by analysing how digital technologies such as BIM are applied within the Snowdon Towers project. The first step is to identify key processes, stakeholders, and information flows to understand the current digital working method. This is done to reveal dependencies, responsibilities, and data exchange points within the project. Based on this analysis, a BIM Execution Plan is developed to formalise roles, modelling standards, and collaboration procedures. This BEP is used as a guideline for the concept development within this course. Together, these steps provide insight into how digital transformation influences project workflows and organisational decision-making.</p>
      <p><b>A copy of the BIM execution plan can be downloaded <a href="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/executionplan.pdf"download>here</a>.</b></p>
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Developmental challenges</u></p>
        <p>The main challenges in developing a BIM Execution Plan differ for each project. Small projects face other issues than large ones. For large projects, the BEP will be a more extensive document, and the associated risks will be higher. In many cases, the project goals are not formulated in a SMART way, which makes expectations unclear. As projects become bigger and more complex, this lack of clarity increases.</p>
        <p>Another challenge is that the models for the different disciplines are often created in different software environments. This makes interoperability more difficult. Without clear agreements on the use of the IFC standard, information exchange can become chaotic during the project.</p>
        <p>The BEP must be understandable for everyone who works with it. Besides covering the legal and contractual requirements of the project, it should function as a practical guide for users, leading to better results. A well‑designed BEP should improve efficiency on site and during design and coordination.</p>
        <p>Software version management poses an additional challenge. At the start of the project, the software versions to be used are fixed. If updates are released during the project, teams are often not allowed to switch to the newer version and must continue working with the older one. This can create technical limitations and coordination issues.</p>
        <p>In many cases, BIM managers draft the BIM Execution Plan away from the work floor, which can make the document too theoretical and not aligned with daily practice. To avoid this, the relevant discipline managers and key users should be actively involved in preparing the BEP, so that it reflects real workflows and needs.</p>
      <p><u>Added value</u></p>
        <p>The added value of a BIM Execution Plan for companies and organizations is that it clearly describes all relevant aspects of the BIM process and defines who is responsible for what. It acts as a practical guide throughout the project. The BEP describes the different stages of developing the BIM model and provides project information, so that all project details become transparent.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it lists the project goals and explains how BIM will be used to support each objective, including the priority of the various goals. It defines organizational roles, so everyone knows their responsibilities and the responsibilities of others. The BIM process design gives an overview of how the process will run, so team members understand what is expected of them.</p>
        <p>The BEP also describes how collaboration will take place during the project, including the structure and frequency of coordination meetings. The section on project deliverables clarifies deadlines and required formats, which helps the team to plan and work towards these milestones.</p>
        <p>Finally, the delivery strategy sets out the legal and contractual arrangements for the project. It clarifies the rights and obligations of each party, reduces misunderstandings, and supports a more predictable and controlled project delivery.</p>

  <h2>Concept 2 – BIM modelling and interoperability</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Model stakeholders</u></p>
        During the BIM model development phase, many different stakeholders are involved. These include developers, owners, architects, and engineers from various design disciplines (Borrmann et al., 2018). On the construction side, general contractors and construction managers work together with trade specialists such as steel, masonry, and plumbing contractors (Ikerd & FORUM, 2020). Within these organisations, project managers, modelers, designers, and estimators are responsible for building and maintaining the digital model (Sacks et al., 2025). In some cases, manufacturers, material suppliers, and government regulators or inspectors are also involved to ensure compliance with technical and legal requirements (Borrmann et al., 2018).
      <p><u>Required datasets</u></p>
        Creating a BIM model requires several types of data (Borrmann et al., 2018). The basis is 3D geometry with parametric rules, which allows elements to be adjusted intelligently (Sacks et al., 2025). This geometry is enriched with semantic data, such as material properties, fire ratings, technical specifications, and cost information (Sacks et al., 2025). The model also follows a spatial hierarchy, ranging from the overall project and site to individual building levels and spaces (Borrmann et al., 2018). For more complex projects, scheduling information is added to enable 4D simulations of construction phases (Sacks et al., 2025). In addition, reality capture data, such as point clouds from laser scanning or drones, is used to ensure the model accurately reflects the existing site conditions (Ikerd & FORUM, 2020).

    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Developmental challenges</u></p>
        <p>The most significant challenge for interoperability when working with IFC is that specific properties can be lost during the export or conversion process. In practice, several recurring export issues are observed. The ten most common mistakes when exporting to IFC are: (BIM Corner, 2023a, 2023b)</p>
        <p>•	Incorrectly named project IFC properties</p>
        <p>•	Wrong object classification</p>
        <p>•	Exporting too many objects</p>
        <p>•	Exporting placeholders or other parties’ objects</p>
        <p>•	Incorrect number and naming of storeys</p>
        <p>•	Exporting too many properties</p>
        <p>•	Missing required properties</p>
        <p>•	Incorrect model rotation and base point placement</p>
        <p>•	Exporting overly detailed geometry</p>
        <p>•	Using an incorrect IFC schema</p>
        <p>Another challenge is that shapes are modelled and simplified differently across authoring tools. Each software package may represent and interpret geometry in its own way, which can lead to discrepancies after IFC export and import (BIM Corner, 2023a).</p>
        <p>In addition, the larger and more detailed the model becomes, the slower the software response time. Highly detailed models can significantly reduce performance and make it difficult to work efficiently. To avoid this, the level of detail is often limited, especially since available hardware may not be powerful enough to handle very large, highly detailed IFC models smoothly.</p>
        <p>For complex projects, it may be necessary to split the model into several parts to keep file sizes manageable. However, dividing the model in this way can reduce the clarity and overall overview of the project, making coordination and review more difficult.</p>
      <p><u>Decision improvement</u></p>
        The decisions that can be improved by using the developed artifact concern system specification, design and the allocation of responsibilities. The SBS clarifies which systems and subsystems are present in the BIM model, who is responsible for them, and which information is required for each element. This leads to a more systematic and well-founded reasoning about the different parts of the project. By integrating more systems into a single BIM model, clashes, interfaces and conflicts become visible, which supports better and more accurate choices for different parts of the project. Furthermore, by using the SBS ID, the model improves decisions related to planning, costs and changes, because every object is assigned to a system and work package, which is in line with findings on 5D BIM-based cost and planning control and standardized information classification in BIM. This makes it easier to prioritise tasks, evaluate changes and plan maintenance (Pishdad & Onungwa, 2024; digiGO, 2024).
      <p><u>Further opportunities</u></p>
        Use software to automatically generate the SBS structure from the BIM metadata, eliminating manual errors in the breakdown. Link the SBS to time (4D) for the construction phase and to cost (5D) for budget control, so that any change in the model automatically updates the schedule and cost information. Integrate sensors for real-time monitoring of the objects in the BIM/SBS, enabling timely adjustments where needed.

  <h2>Concept 3 – Information systems for construction</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Involved stakeholders</u></p>
        To ensure constructability  throughout the project lifecycle there are several stakeholders to identify. The stakeholders with the greatest impact are the asset owner and the architect, as they establish the initial design intent and requirements. Furthermore, the main contractor and various subcontractors have a critical role in validating the feasibility of the design and proposing practical construction methods. Other important stakeholders are the BIM coordinator and BIM designer, who are responsible for the digital models and coordinate the clash detection processes. Another important stakeholder throughout the project is the document controller, which ensures that all information is organized and accessible.
      <p><u>Integrated datasets</u></p>
        <p>The datasets integrated from the information systems are listed below:</p> 
        <p>• 3D  data from Revit, including clash detection</p>
        <p>• 4D  data from MS Project</p>
        <p>• 5D  cost data from cost databases, providing insight into the costs of different activities</p>
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Artifact</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Clash detection</u></p>
        <p>A clash detection report was made to ensure seamless construction of the Snowdon Towers. In this report, clashes between the structural and HVAC models were documented, and a total of 48 clashes were initially identified. Three cases of clashes were examined in detail, and all the clashes occurred between the duct work and the concrete floor slabs at different grids and levels due to poor vertical coordination. These clashes highlighted the conflicts between the mechanical services and the structural elements, where the services and structural elements shared the same space. These clashes were resolved by modifying the structural model using Revit, and the clashes were shown to be reduced using Navisworks.</p>
        <p><b>A copy of the clash detection report can be downloaded <a href="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/clashreport.pdf"download>here</a>.</b></p>
      <p><u>4D animation</u></p>
        <p>A 4D animation of the construction of the Snowdon Towers has been complied, as shown below:</p>
        <div style="max-width:600px; margin:2rem auto;"><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1159263944?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="animationbefore"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></div>
        <p>This animation used a generic task sequence which, if used, would make construction impossible.
        <br />For example, construction cannot begin on the car park before the foundations are installed.</p>
        <p>A revised 4D animation of the construction has therefore been compiled, as shown below:</p>
        <div style="max-width:600px; margin:2rem auto;"><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1159265836?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="animationafter"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></div>
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Developmental challenges</u></p>
        <p>During the development of the clash detection report, several challenges became apparent. Integrating multiple discipline models required careful coordination. Architectural, structural, and MEP models were not always aligned in terms of modelling level and accuracy. This resulted in a large number of clashes that were not all practically relevant. Distinguishing between critical clashes and modelling inaccuracies required manual interpretation and engineering judgement.</p>
        <p>Resolving clashes also proved to be more complex than expected. Adjusting one model element often affected other systems. This showed how interdependent the disciplines are within a BIM environment. The process was iterative and time consuming. It required repeated checks to ensure that resolving one issue did not introduce new conflicts.</p>
        <p>The creation of the 4D BIM animation introduced different challenges. Linking model elements to the construction schedule required a clear understanding of construction logic. The schedule data itself was not always detailed enough to represent real construction sequences. This made it difficult to accurately visualise site activities over time. Technical limitations of the software also influenced the level of detail that could be achieved. These challenges highlighted the gap between theoretical planning and practical construction processes.</p>
      <p><u>Decision improvement</u></p>
        <p>The clash detection artifact improved my understanding of early stage decision making. As a construction project manager, the ability to identify and resolve clashes before construction directly supports cost and risk control. The visual nature of the clash detection results made it easier to justify design changes. Decisions were no longer based on assumptions but on clearly identified conflicts in the model. This increased confidence in coordination meetings and improved communication between stakeholders.</p>
        <p>The 4D BIM animation had a strong impact on planning related decisions. Visualising the construction sequence over time revealed issues that would not be obvious in a traditional schedule. Spatial conflicts and inefficient sequencing became visible. This supported better decisions regarding task order and site organisation. The artifact also demonstrated the value of BIM in communicating planning risks to non technical stakeholders. It showed how early identification of problems can prevent delays during construction.</p>
      <p><u>Further opportunities</u></p>
        <p>With additional time and resources, the clash detection artifact could evolve from a coordination tool into a strategic decision support system. One important improvement would be the implementation of stricter modelling standards across all disciplines. Consistent object classification, modelling tolerances, and levels of detail would significantly reduce irrelevant clashes. This would allow the focus to shift from model cleaning to decision making.</p>
        <p>Further value could be created by introducing rule based clash detection. Instead of relying only on geometric intersections, clashes could be evaluated based on constructability rules and clearance requirements. This would improve the quality of detected issues and reduce manual interpretation. Linking clash results to issue management platforms would improve traceability and accountability. Each resolved clash could be documented together with its design decision and impact.</p>
        <p>The 4D BIM animation also offers strong opportunities for further development. A direct integration with professional scheduling software would allow automatic updating of the construction sequence. This would enable scenario analysis. Different sequencing options could be tested to evaluate their impact on site logistics and critical paths. This would support more informed planning decisions during early project phases.</p>
        <p>An additional improvement would be the integration of cost information. Linking construction activities to cost data would allow a transition towards 5D BIM. This would enable the evaluation of financial consequences of planning decisions. Changes in sequencing or clash resolutions could be assessed not only in time but also in cost. This would strengthen the role of the construction project manager in value driven decision making.</p>

  <h2>Concept 4 – Information systems for maintenance and asset management</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Involved stakeholders</u></p>
        For the maintainability stakeholders we focus on the operational phase of the asset. The most important stakeholders are the asset owner and the asset manager, as they are responsible for the functioning of the asset and its maintenance. Other important stakeholders are the contractors and suppliers because they provide built information and specifications of the elements. Additionally, the inspectors and regulatory bodies are important stakeholders because their safety and maintenance standards must be met. The last important stakeholder for this part is the BIM coordinator, which is responsible for the integrity and structure of the information as it moves from design and construction into the operational systems. 
      <p><u>Integrated datasets</u></p>
        <p>The datasets that are integrated from the information systems are:</p>
        <p>• The asset register can be obtained by the BIM model in Revit</p>
        <p>• Component details can be obtained by the information from the suppliers</p>
        <p>• Maintenance plans can be obtained by Relatics</p>
        <p>• Condition data can be obtained by the IoT platforms.</p>
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Artifact</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Maintenance management</u></p>
        <p>This concept focuses on translating design-oriented BIM information into a maintenance and asset management context. The first step is to import the models from Concepts 1 and 2 into a maintenance management system to ensure continuity of information. This is done to reuse existing data and avoid information loss after construction. Additional parameters, such as maintenance manuals and schedules, are then added to align the model with maintenance needs. These parameters support location-based management rather than object-based design logic. Finally, a dashboard is created to visualise asset status and maintenance requirements, enabling more efficient and informed decision-making during the operational phase.</p>

    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Developmental challenges</u></p>
        <p>Developing the maintenance management artifact revealed several challenges related to time, tooling, and data scope. Importing the models from earlier concepts into a maintenance management system required a shift in perspective. The model had to be interpreted from an operational rather than a design viewpoint. Not all information available in the BIM model was directly relevant for maintenance management.</p>
        <p>In this case, no assets were removed from the model. A deliberate choice was made to work quickly and efficiently because the Autodesk Tandem account would be frozen after thirty days. For a conceptual exploration such as this assignment, this approach was considered acceptable. The focus was on demonstrating system functionality and supporting decision making, rather than achieving complete asset coverage.</p>
        <p>However, this limitation would become problematic in a long term project context. Temporary accounts and platform restrictions are not suitable for long term asset management. In a realistic project setting, such constraints could lead to data loss, inconsistent maintenance information, and limited transferability to the operational phase. This experience highlighted the importance of stable digital infrastructure and clear agreements on software licensing in long duration construction and facility management projects.</p>
        <p>Adding maintenance related parameters introduced further challenges. Information such as maintenance manuals and schedules was not always available and often had to be approximated. This required assumptions and underlined the dependency of asset management systems on reliable and structured input data. Creating a maintenance dashboard also required careful selection of indicators to avoid information overload while still supporting meaningful insights.</p>
      <p><u>Decision improvement</u></p>
        <p>The maintenance management model supported improved decision making from an asset management perspective. The structured overview of building assets increased transparency and control. Critical systems such as elevators, HVAC installations, and electrical components could be monitored more effectively. This improved decisions related to inspection planning and maintenance prioritisation.</p>
        <p>The dashboard provided a clear overview of upcoming maintenance activities and asset status. This supported a shift from reactive to more planned maintenance strategies. Decisions related to budgeting and resource allocation were therefore better informed. The visual nature of the dashboard also improved communication with stakeholders who are not directly involved in day to day technical maintenance.</p>
        <p>Despite the time constrained development process, the artifact demonstrated the value of early asset information structuring. Decisions regarding long term operability and maintainability became more explicit. This reinforced the role of digital asset management systems in supporting lifecycle oriented decision making.</p>
      <p><u>Further opportunities</u></p>
        <p>With more time and resources, the maintenance management artifact could be further strengthened. In a real project context, the use of a permanent and fully licensed asset management platform would be essential. This would ensure continuity of data throughout the building lifecycle and support long term decision making.</p>
        <p>Further development could include deeper integration with building management systems. Real time performance data could be linked to asset parameters. This would enable predictive maintenance strategies instead of fixed interval scheduling. The dashboard could also be expanded to include lifecycle cost data and asset condition indicators. This would support long term replacement and investment decisions.</p>
        <p>Finally, stronger integration with earlier BIM and construction phase models would improve information consistency. Asset data could be progressively enriched from design through construction and into operation. This would create a robust digital foundation for effective and informed asset management over the full lifecycle of the building.</p>

  <h2>Concept 5 – Information systems for sustainability</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Involved stakeholders</u></p>
        The most important sustainability stakeholders are the asset owner and project developer, as they need to meet the sustainability goals and procurement criteria (Wang et al., 2025). Furthermore, the architect team, design team, structural engineers, and MEP engineers are important because they have to find the most sustainable solution, hereby they have to make different choices to find the most sustainable solution (Wang et al., 2025).  In addition, the supplier is an important stakeholder, which provides the information about the materials needed to perform the different calculations and decision-making. Another key stakeholder is the LCA specialist, who performs the quantitative environmental impact analysis. The BIM coordinator ensures effective data exchange between the different models and the sustainability analysis software.
      <p><u>Integrated datasets</u></p>
        <p>The datasets that are integrated from the information systems are:</p>
        <p>• Material quantities, EPDs, and embodied carbon are obtained from BIM model in Revit and the LCA plugins (One Click LCA, 2025).</p>
        <p>• Energy performance data is obtained from simulation tools.</p>

      <p><u>Sustainability analysis</u></p>
        <p>This concept explores how BIM can be used to support sustainability analysis within a construction project. The first step is to import the models from Concepts 1 and 2 into sustainability analysis software. The model is simplified by removing unnecessary details to ensure reliable and efficient calculations. This is done to focus the analysis on relevant material quantities and system boundaries. An embodied carbon analysis is then performed to identify which building components contribute most to environmental impact. Finally, a dashboard is created to visualise these results. This supports comparison of design choices and improves sustainability-related decision-making.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/overviewside.png" style="display:block; margin:2rem auto; max-height:400px; width:100%; width:auto;">
      <p><u>Embodied carbon</u></p>
        <p>This chapter analyses the carbon emissions of the Snowdon Towers project based on the BIM-based carbon assessment outputs. Both embodied carbon and operational carbon are considered, allowing insight into which materials, building elements, and energy sources contribute most to the total carbon footprint.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/summarypart1.png" style="display:block; margin:2rem auto; max-width:600px; max-height:250px; width:100%; height:auto;">
        <img src="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/summarypart2.png" style="display:block; margin:2rem auto; max-width:600px; max-height:250px; width:100%; height:auto;">
        <p><i>Overall carbon breakdown</i></p>
        <p>The total carbon emissions of the Snowdon Towers model amount to approximately 464,900 kgCO₂e. This total consists of two main components. The embodied carbon is around 287,600 kgCO₂e, while the operational carbon is approximately 177,300 kgCO₂e. This means that embodied carbon accounts for roughly 62% of the total carbon impact, indicating that material choices and construction methods play a larger role than building operation in this design.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/byconstruction.png" style="display:block; margin:2rem auto; max-width:490px; max-height:250px; height:auto;">
        <p><i>Embodied carbon by building element</i></p>
        <p>The embodied carbon results show a clear dominance of structural and envelope-related elements. The exterior walls contribute the highest share, with approximately 66,600 kgCO₂e. This high impact can be explained by the large surface area combined with carbon-intensive materials such as concrete, insulation layers, and façade systems. Similarly, underground walls and slabs represent a significant source of embodied carbon, together exceeding 98,000 kgCO₂e. These elements rely heavily on reinforced concrete, which has high emissions due to cement production (O’Hegarty et al., 2025).</p>
        <p>Another major contributor is the R-13 wood frame wall system, which alone accounts for over 66,000 kgCO₂e. While timber is often considered a low-carbon material, the total impact here is driven by the large quantity used, additional insulation, and associated finishes. Roofs and interior walls also show notable embodied carbon values, indicating that secondary building elements still have a measurable environmental impact (O’Hegarty et al., 2025).</p>
        <p>By contrast, components such as shades, ceilings, and interior floors contribute relatively little on an individual level. However, their combined impact is not negligible and illustrates how cumulative “small” elements can still influence the total embodied carbon.</p>
        <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:1rem; max-width:1000px; margin:2rem auto;">
        <img src="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/bymaterialconcrete.png" style="max-width:490px; max-height:250px; object-fit:contain;">
        <img src="https://raw.github.com/tzmartinrblx/ISftCI-Group-22/main/bymaterialcarpet.png"  style="max-width:490px; max-height:250px; object-fit:contain;">
        </div>
        <p><i>Material-related drivers</i></p>
        <p>From a material perspective, the results suggest that concrete-based elements are the primary drivers of embodied carbon. This is visible in slabs on grade, underground structures, and reinforced wall systems. The high mass of these components, combined with carbon-intensive cement, leads to large emissions (O’Hegarty et al., 2025). Glazing systems and exterior openings also show a considerable contribution, mainly due to aluminium frames and double-glazed units with high manufacturing energy demand (Sinha et al., 2012).</p>
        <p><i>Operational carbon and energy sources</i></p>
        <p>Operational carbon emissions are split between electricity and fossil-fuel-based district heating and cooling. Electricity use contributes approximately 91,600 kgCO₂e per year, making it the largest single operational source. District heating adds around 47,100 kgCO₂e, while district cooling contributes roughly 38,600 kgCO₂e.</p>
        <p>The presence of district heating and cooling indicates partial reliance on fossil fuel–based energy systems. Although district systems can be more efficient than individual boilers, their carbon intensity strongly depends on the energy mix (Jaspers, 2024). In this case, fossil fuel use still plays a significant role, which increases the operational carbon footprint.</p>
        <p><i>Key observations and implications</i></p>
        <p>Overall, the analysis shows that the structural system and building envelope dominate embodied carbon, while electricity consumption dominates operational carbon. This suggests that carbon reduction strategies should focus first on material optimisation, such as reducing concrete volumes, using low-carbon concrete alternatives (O’Hegarty et al., 2025), or increasing the use of bio-based materials where feasible (Sinha et al., 2012). On the operational side, reducing electricity demand and transitioning to renewable energy sources would significantly lower long-term emissions (Hayter, 2011).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the Snowdon Towers project demonstrates a typical pattern for contemporary buildings, where embodied carbon outweighs operational carbon in early design stages. BIM-based carbon analysis proves valuable in identifying high-impact elements and provides a clear basis for design decisions aimed at reducing the overall carbon footprint (O’Hegarty et al., 2025).</p>

    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Developmental challenges</u></p>
        <p>Developing the sustainability analysis artifact required a careful translation of design models into an environmental assessment context. The original BIM models contained a high level of geometric and informational detail. Much of this detail was unnecessary for embodied carbon analysis. Stripping the model while maintaining relevant material quantities required deliberate simplification and judgement. For this reason, only the architectural model was used for the analysis. This choice improved efficiency and reduced modelling complexity. However, it also meant that not all building components were included. As a result, the embodied carbon assessment does not fully represent the complete building and should be interpreted as a partial analysis rather than a comprehensive evaluation.</p>
        <p>Mapping building elements to environmental datasets was a further challenge. Material definitions in the BIM model did not always directly correspond to categories used in sustainability software. This required assumptions and approximations. Differences in databases and default values introduced uncertainty into the results. Ensuring consistency between the model and the carbon assessment therefore required manual verification.</p>
        <p>Creating a sustainability dashboard also presented challenges. Embodied carbon data can be complex and difficult to interpret. Selecting indicators that clearly communicate the contribution of different building components required an understanding of sustainability metrics. The challenge was to balance analytical accuracy with clarity for decision making.</p>
      <p><u>Decision improvement</u></p>
        <p>The sustainability analysis artifact significantly improved sustainability related decision making. As a project manager, the embodied carbon breakdown provided insight into which building components had the greatest environmental impact. Structural elements and façade systems became clearly identifiable as major contributors. This supported more informed discussions on design optimisation.</p>
        <p>The dashboard enabled comparison between different building components. Decisions regarding material selection and system design were therefore improved. Instead of treating sustainability as a general objective, specific targets could be linked to measurable outcomes. The visualisation supported communication with designers and stakeholders. Sustainability trade offs became easier to explain and justify.</p>
        <p>The artifact also supported early intervention. By identifying high impact components early, sustainability measures could be integrated before design decisions became fixed. This improved decisions related to design iteration timing and prioritisation of sustainability efforts.</p>
      <p><u>Further opportunities</u></p>
        <p>With more time and resources, the sustainability analysis artifact could be further enhanced. Higher quality and project specific material data could be used instead of generic database values. This would improve the accuracy of embodied carbon results. Integration with local environmental product declarations would further strengthen reliability.</p>
        <p>The artifact could also be expanded to include operational carbon analysis. Linking embodied carbon results with energy simulation models would provide a more holistic sustainability assessment. This would support decisions that balance short term embodied impacts with long term operational performance.</p>
        <p>Further integration with cost and planning models could also be beneficial. Linking embodied carbon data to 4D and 5D BIM would allow evaluation of carbon impacts over time and in relation to cost. This would support carbon informed scheduling and procurement decisions. Ultimately, combining sustainability analysis with other BIM based artifacts would enable more comprehensive and data driven decision making throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

  <h2>Concept 6 – Information systems for safety</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Involved stakeholders</u></p>
        The most important safety stakeholder is the asset owner, who sets the safety requirements for the project. Other key stakeholders are the safety managers and HSE managers, they develop the risk registers and compliance protocols (Zhang et al., 2020). The project managers and construction managers are also key stakeholders, as they take care of the safety on site and of the structure. Additionally, the BIM team and design team are key stakeholders as well, since they create the digital models that form the basis for safety analysis. The contractors, subcontractors, structural engineers and inspectors play an important role as well since they validate these models against the actual site conditions and regulations (Zhang et al., 2020).
      <p><u>Integrated datasets</u></p>
        <p>The datasets that are integrated from the information systems to do safety analysis are:</p>
        <p>• 3D/4D geometry which are obtained from BIM platforms Revit and Navisworks (Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>• Scheduling is obtained from 4D tools like MS Project.</p>

      <p><u>Developmental challenges</u></p>
        <p>Developing the safety walkthrough artifact presented several practical and conceptual challenges. Translating safety risks into a digital model required interpretation rather than direct data input. Many safety issues are context dependent and rely on construction phase conditions. These conditions were not always explicitly represented in the concept model.</p>
        <p>Identifying safety problems through a virtual walkthrough required an understanding of construction activities over time. The static nature of the model limited the visibility of temporary hazards. Examples include fall risks, restricted access routes, and interaction between workers and equipment. This required assumptions about construction sequencing and worker behaviour.</p>
        <p>Modifying the model to remove safety issues introduced additional challenges. Safety improvements such as guardrails or protected openings had to be modelled explicitly. This increased model complexity and required careful placement to remain realistic. Showing before and after conditions side by side also required clear visual consistency. Any modelling inaccuracies could reduce the clarity of the safety improvement.</p>
      <p><u>Decision improvement</u></p>
        <p>The safety walkthrough artifact supported more informed safety related decision making. As a project manager, the visual identification of hazards improved situational awareness. Safety risks became visible rather than abstract. This supported earlier intervention in the design and planning stages.</p>
        <p>The before resolution and after resolution comparison strengthened safety decisions. It allowed direct evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Decisions regarding protective elements, access routes, and spatial separation were improved. The artifact supported discussions with designers and contractors by providing a shared visual reference.</p>
        <p>This approach also supported a preventive safety mindset. Rather than responding to incidents, safety risks were addressed during design development. This improved decisions related to risk prioritisation and resource allocation. The artifact demonstrated how design choices directly influence site safety outcomes.</p>
      <p><u>Further opportunities</u></p>
        <p>With more time and resources, the safety walkthrough artifact could be expanded significantly. Integrating the safety model with a 4D construction sequence would improve hazard identification over time. This would allow safety risks to be assessed per construction phase rather than in a static condition.</p>
        <p>Further improvement could be achieved by linking the model to formal risk assessment tools. Safety hazards could be classified according to risk severity and probability. This would support more structured safety decision making. Automated safety rule checks could also be implemented. Examples include minimum edge protection heights and safe access clearances.</p>
        <p>The artifact could also benefit from integration with training and communication tools. Virtual reality or interactive walkthroughs would improve engagement and understanding among site personnel. This would support decisions related to toolbox talks and safety inductions.</p>
        <p>In the long term, integrating the safety walkthrough with real time site data could support proactive safety management. Sensor data and progress tracking could be compared with the planned safety measures. Deviations could be identified early. This would allow continuous improvement of safety decisions throughout the construction phase.</p>

  <h2>Concept 7 – Information systems for future construction</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
        <p>The future of construction information systems is characterized by a transition from traditional three-dimensional design toward becoming the centerpiece of a full digital transformation across the entire asset lifecycle (World Economic Forum, 2018). Current research suggests that future systems will power technologies like prefabrication and automated construction equipment while facilitating the creation of digital twins for entire systems to improve strategic planning and operation (World Economic Forum, 2018). These digital twins provide long term value for the operation of a building by linking sensor data to monitor performance and support predictive maintenance (World Economic Forum, 2018).</p>
        <p>Future systems are also expected to include advanced green attributes such as bio nan robots that synthesize materials from atmospheric carbon to allow structures to essentially build themselves (Lu et al., 2017). Furthermore, the integration of Building Information Modeling and Geographic Information Systems provides a highly detailed and holistic picture of projects that enhances asset management and urban planning tasks (Fosu et al., 2015). Technical advances like automated code checking and scan to BIM processes aim to reduce the high modeling effort and conversion costs currently associated with capturing data for existing structures (Volk et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>The complex vertical structure including elevators and stair cores is ideally suited for predictive maintenance systems that monitor usage patterns and maintenance needs to reduce downtime (World Economic Forum, 2018). Such a system can offer instant access to relevant data about objects such as elevators to ensure maintenance crews respond faster and more efficiently (World Economic Forum, 2018). </p>
        <p>The extensive glass facades of the project can be optimized through BIM based solar radiation and lighting simulations which visualize building performance and radiant exchange during the early design phase (Lu et al., 2017). For the green roof terraces, BIM software can support water usage analysis and carbon emission calculations to ensure the building meets established sustainability goals (Lu et al., 2017). The basement parking and utility infrastructure can be managed through BIM and GIS integration which allows for the visualization of sub surface pipelines and better emergency situation responses (Fosu et al., 2015). </p>
        <p>Additionally, the use of cloud based BIM collaboration can improve the coordination of diverse stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle to ensure information is shared accurately and consistently (World Economic Forum, 2018). </p>
        <p>Overall, future information systems would allow the Snowdon Towers project to manage vertical complexity more effectively. They would support better design, safer construction, and more efficient building operation. This demonstrates how emerging technologies can enhance value across the entire lifecycle of a high rise office and residential building.</p>

      <p><u>Virtual sensor</u></p>
        <p>For Artifact 7, we connected our building, the Snowdon Towers, to a virtual sensor stream using Autodesk Tandem. We linked the digital model to real-time sensor data (for temperature and humidity) by integrating a script hosted on GitHub with our Tandem model.</p>

      <p><u>Sensor dashboard</u></p>
        <p>As a result, the dashboard now visualizes the temperature and humidity metrics for the asset.</p>

    <div class="sub"><h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>
      <p><u>Developmental challenges</u></p>
        The primary challenge encountered during artifact development was establishing a stable integration between GitHub and Autodesk Tandem. Initial attempts to link the platforms were unsuccessful; however, refreshing the credentials within both the GitHub repository and Autodesk Tandem resolved the connectivity issue. Beyond this integration hurdle, the development process proceeded without significant complications. 
      <p><u>Further opportunities</u></p>
        <p>While our current scripts are capable of predicting failures, the next step involves deep integration with a facility management system to operationalize these predictions. In this future state, the system would automatically trigger a work order via an API and schedule the appropriate technician without human intervention (Autodesk, 2023).</p>
        <p>A further enhancement would be linking predicted maintenance interventions to our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This would allow the system to calculate and compare the CO₂ impact of immediate repair versus delayed replacement. This view would allow managers to compare scenarios of immediate repair vs delayed replacement on cost, risk, and emissions in a dashboard, supporting more transparent and data driven decisions. Consequently, maintenance decisions would be driven by sustainability metrics in addition to traditional cost and technical factors (Rahim et al., 2024).</p>
